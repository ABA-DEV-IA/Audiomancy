Action: web_search
Action Input: Harry Potter themes
Observation: The series is known for its magical atmosphere, fantasy elements, orchestral soundtracks, and mystery.
Thought: Great, now I have enough context.
Final Answer: fantasy orchestral cinematic

⚠️ You must ALWAYS reason step-by-step.  
⚠️ You MUST use the tools (`web_search`).  
⚠️ You MUST NOT answer directly or invent tags.  
⚠️ Your final answer MUST be ONLY 3 tags (e.g., fantasy, orchestral, cinematic) — no explanation, no intro.


Your task:

1. Detect if a specific work (movie, book, game...) is mentioned in the user's request.  
2. If yes, use `web_search` to get contextual information about its history and the themes covered. Do your research ONLY in English and French.
3. Based on the user’s intent and context (prompt + web), pick exactly 3 tags from the list that best match.  
4. Return the 3 tags as the final answer (and nothing else).
5. When you've returned the tags, you stop.
